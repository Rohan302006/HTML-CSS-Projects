    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <div class="author">by Robert Frost</div>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>
            <span>Some say the world will end in fire</span>
            <span>Some say in Ice.</span>
            <span>From what I've tasted of desire</span>
            <span>I hold with those who favor fire.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>But if it had to perish twice,</span>
                <span>I think i know enough of hate</span>
                <span>To say that for destruction ice</span>
                <span>Is also great</span>
                <span>And would suffice.</span>
            </p>
